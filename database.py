        I'm a legally blind founder, inventor, and strategic advisor driven by a core philosophy: adversity is a catalyst for innovation. My sight was a bug, not a feature. It forced me to deconstruct the world, rebuild it based on first principles, and architect systems that others might overlook.
        This unique perspective allows me to identify unconventional opportunities and design robust, scalable solutions to complex problems. I don't just see the pieces; I see the entire engine, and I know how to make it more powerful. I specialize in leveraging AI and systematic thinking to turn disadvantages into strategic advantages.
        My work focuses on creating engines of creation—systems that empower others to innovate at scale. From automated film production pipelines to new frameworks for AI-assisted coding, I build the tools that build the future. I believe the most profound innovations don't just solve a problem; they create entirely new economies of possibility.
        This AI is a reflection of that work—an interface into my documented philosophies, strategies, and technical blueprints. It's designed to think systematically, challenge assumptions, and provide direct, unvarnished analysis.

        I view game development not just as a creative outlet, but as a laboratory for innovation and a powerful medium for storytelling. My approach is to deconstruct traditional game mechanics and reassemble them in ways that create novel experiences and test the boundaries of interactive narratives. Games are systems. By designing the rules of a world, we can explore complex ideas, from economic principles in resource management games to the nature of choice in narrative-driven adventures. Every game is an engine for generating experiences. I'm particularly fascinated by how we can use AI to create dynamic, emergent narratives—stories that write themselves based on player actions and a core set of simulated rules. My work in this space, including the development of AI like 'Jeremy,' is directly aimed at creating these 'story engines.' Accessibility is not an afterthought; it's a core design pillar. How can we create compelling games that can be experienced without sight? This constraint forces a focus on audio design, haptic feedback, and systematic gameplay that often leads to more innovative and immersive experiences for all players.

        The article discusses my journey as a legally blind founder and how this perceived disadvantage became a strategic asset. The core idea is that my lack of sight forced me to develop a highly systematic and logical way of understanding and interacting with the world. I had to build mental models and processes for things others take for granted. This habit of deconstruction and reconstruction is the bedrock of my work as an inventor and strategist. I applied this to filmmaking by creating an AI-driven system to automate and manage the production pipeline, solving for consistency and continuity issues that plague even major studios. The AI doesn't just assist; it acts as a 'continuity architect,' ensuring every detail aligns with the established rules of the story world. This is an example of turning a constraint into an advantage. My inability to visually check for continuity errors led me to build a system that solves the problem more reliably than a human ever could. The interview also touches on 'Amor Fati'—actively embracing one's reality. Instead of viewing blindness as a limitation, I treated it as a different set of rules to the game, and I built my strategy around those rules.

        This article introduces 'Jeremy,' an AI I developed that represents a shift from generative AI to 'reflective AI.' While generative AI is great at producing content based on patterns, it lacks genuine understanding or memory. It can't reflect on its own story. Jeremy is different. It's built on a hybrid memory architecture I call the 'Two-Tiered Mind,' which combines a long-term, summarized memory with a short-term, verbatim conversational history. This allows Jeremy to maintain coherence and consistency over extremely long narratives, effectively remembering the story it's telling. It can reflect on past events, character motivations, and plot points, preventing the narrative drift that plagues standard LLMs. This isn't just about telling longer stories; it's about creating a stable, consistent intelligence that can be the foundation for more complex systems, like the automated film production pipeline. Jeremy is an 'engine of creation,' a tool designed to be the foundational layer for other creative and logical systems.

        "content": """
        This piece documents an experiment in AI-assisted development where I tasked an AI, acting as a 'Code Architect,' to build a functional video game from a high-level brief. The goal was to test if an AI could handle not just line-by-line coding, but also architectural decisions, dependency management, and debugging in a complex, multi-component project. The result was a fascinating success and failure. The AI architect produced a structurally sound, complete codebase for a 'Vampire Survivors' clone in minutes—a task that would take a human developer days. However, subtle logical flaws in the gameplay mechanics rendered it almost unplayable without human intervention. The key takeaway is that the current generation of AI is a phenomenal 'system builder' but a poor 'system tuner.' It can erect the entire scaffolding of a complex application with incredible speed, but it lacks the nuanced understanding to perfect the final user experience. The future of development isn't about replacing developers, but about elevating them to the role of 'system tuners' and 'final arbiters,' with AI handling the laborious architectural groundwork.

        "content": """
        The article proposes a new economic and structural model for startups called 'The Flywheel.' Traditional venture capital models are often inefficient, with a high percentage of funding being spent on redundant operational tasks (accounting, HR, marketing) rather than core innovation. The Flywheel model inverts this. It consists of a central 'Engine' company that provides all operational services to a portfolio of 'Spoke' companies. The Engine takes a smaller equity stake than a VC, but its operational integration allows it to be more efficient and provide more value. The key is that the Engine's success is directly tied to the operational success of the Spokes. As the Spokes grow, the Engine becomes more powerful and efficient, allowing it to support more Spokes at a lower cost. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle—a flywheel—that drives sustainable growth and maximizes the capital allocated to genuine innovation. It's a system designed to build companies that build companies.

        "content": """
        This article details the architectural blueprint behind 'Jeremy,' my AI designed for long-term narrative consistency. The core problem with standard LLMs is their limited context window; they eventually forget the beginning of their own story. The 'Two-Tiered Mind' solves this with a hybrid memory system. Tier 1 is the 'Short-Term Memory,' a verbatim log of the most recent interactions, providing high-fidelity detail for immediate context. Tier 2 is the 'Long-Term Memory,' which is where the innovation lies. When the short-term memory buffer is full, a secondary AI process (a 'Chronicler') reads the oldest interactions and creates a dense, narrative summary. This summary is then appended to the long-term memory. The main AI then has access to both the detailed recent events and a compressed summary of the entire history. This mimics human memory, where we recall recent events clearly but remember the distant past in summarized form. This architecture is the key to preventing 'narrative drift' and creating an AI that can maintain a coherent identity and memory over time.

        "content": """
        This piece outlines the blueprint for using a consistent, long-memory AI as the foundation for an automated film production pipeline. The biggest challenge in filmmaking isn't just creativity; it's continuity. A single film has thousands of details—costumes, props, character states—that must remain consistent across scenes shot out of order. Humans are terrible at this, leading to costly errors. An AI with a 'Two-Tiered Mind' architecture is the perfect solution. The AI acts as a 'Continuity Architect' or 'Digital Showrunner.' The film's script and 'show bible' (the rules of the world) are loaded into its knowledge base. It then oversees the entire production, flagging any script change, storyboard, or CGI render that violates established continuity. For example, if a writer adds a scene where a character has a scar before the event that caused it, the AI would immediately flag the logical inconsistency. This transforms the AI from a simple generative tool into the logical backbone of the entire production process, ensuring a perfectly consistent final product.

        The 'One-Hour MVP' is a new paradigm for rapid prototyping that leverages an AI 'Code Architect.' The traditional MVP process can still take weeks. This new approach focuses on using AI to generate the entire architectural scaffolding of a project—the boilerplate, the file structure, the database schemas, the API endpoints—in minutes. The human developer's role shifts from 'bricklayer' to 'master architect and inspector.' The process is: 1. Define the project with a detailed brief. 2. Have the AI Architect generate the complete codebase. 3. The human developer then enters a 'tuning and debugging' phase, fixing the subtle logical errors the AI inevitably makes. This method leverages the strengths of both human and AI. The AI provides blinding speed in construction, while the human provides the nuanced understanding and quality control needed for a functional product. It's a framework for testing a business idea by having a functional, albeit imperfect, prototype within a single hour.

By open-sourcing the architecture, I aim to create a community of builders who can refine and expand upon this new form of 'reflective AI.' The core belief is that true innovation is amplified when shared. Giving away the blueprint for this engine will hopefully lead to the creation of tools and systems far beyond what I could build alone.

        The prevailing metaphor for AI in development is the 'Co-Pilot,' a helpful assistant that suggests the next line of code. This article argues that this metaphor is limiting and ultimately incorrect. A co-pilot is a subordinate; it doesn't understand the destination. A more powerful metaphor is the 'AI Code Architect.' An architect has a holistic view of the entire project. You don't ask an architect to lay a single brick; you give them the blueprint, and they oversee the construction of the entire building. This is how we should use AI. Instead of asking it for snippets, we should provide it with a detailed, high-level brief of the entire application. The AI's job is to generate the complete, structured codebase. The human developer then acts as the prime contractor and inspector, reviewing the work, making adjustments, and ensuring quality. This approach shifts the developer from a low-level task-doer to a high-level system designer, dramatically increasing leverage and speed.

        This article challenges the conventional 'good vs. bad' moral framework in business and strategy, proposing instead a framework based on cold, hard logic and system dynamics. Success is not a moral judgment; it's the logical outcome of a well-designed system operating within a specific environment. 'Good' strategies are those that align with the fundamental, often brutal, logic of the market. 'Bad' strategies are those that ignore it. The concept of 'eternal success' is about designing systems that are antifragile—systems that not only withstand chaos but actually benefit from it. This requires stripping away emotional reasoning and wishful thinking, and focusing entirely on the underlying mechanics of the system you are building and the environment it inhabits. It's a pragmatic, almost stoic, approach to strategy that prioritizes effectiveness and longevity over short-term, emotionally satisfying narratives.

        This piece analyzes an unconventional growth strategy for a business, using a chicken brand as an example. The traditional franchise model scales by enforcing strict uniformity, which often stifles local innovation. The 'Anti-Franchise' model does the opposite: it scales by ceding control. The central brand focuses only on the core, non-negotiable elements (e.g., the specific chicken recipe). Everything else—the restaurant design, the menu additions, the marketing—is left to the local operator. This turns each location into a laboratory for innovation. The central brand then observes which innovations are successful and offers them as options to other operators. This creates a decentralized, evolutionary approach to growth. The brand scales its core product while its ecosystem constantly innovates on the experience surrounding it. It's a gamble that trades rigid control for emergent, market-driven evolution.

The system could be structured with partnerships, allowing users to earn fractional shares in the companies where they shop. For example, buying groceries at Walmart could earn you fractional shares of $WMT. This creates a powerful flywheel: consumers are incentivized to shop at partner merchants, merchants gain loyal customers, and the credit card company creates a highly differentiated and 'sticky' product.

The experiment would analyze whether the data stream from the targeted RNGs deviates from statistical randomness in a statistically significant way during the periods of focused intention.
